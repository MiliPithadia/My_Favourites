            My favourite hobby is art as it's so nice and colourful. Art helps me clear my mind and lets me be open to it. I always do what I want and don't have to be hiding anything with it. I can do whatever I want without anyone telling me what to draw. If I am ever feeling bored, I know what to do. Pick up a book and a pencil. It helps me think and helps me know more about myself. Art also helps me and others in several things. Below are some ways art helps.

            Makes us a better human being.
